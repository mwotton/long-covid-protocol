# long covid protocol

This is a protocol developed by Long Covid patient [Dr Angela O'Connor](https://twitter.com/amayoco) that has helped her mitigate some long covid effects, including
- fatigue
- brainfog
- MAST cell activation syndrome.
- POTS
- vertigo

At some point there'll be more justification of each recommendation, but at this point it seemed more important to share things that worked.

A more formal preprint can be found [here](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202401.1621)

## Morning 
- drink 1-1.5 litres of osmotic salt and berocca fluid
- take maximum dose of antihistamines, any will do
- one 500mg aspirin tablet

## Evening
- nattokinase I take 3 tablets (6000 units) other people go up to 5 tablets with no ill effects

  Start with one tablet a day for a week to make sure you tolerate it then up to 2-5 tablets a day. Taking on an empty stomach helps with the nausea nattokinase can cause
- one n acetyl cysteine tablet
- multivitamin
- 1 valacyclovir antiviral tablet
- one 500mg ibuprofen tablet
